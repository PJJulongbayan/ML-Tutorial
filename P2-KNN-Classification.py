## FEATURE SET 
df.columns

# to use scikit-learn library, we have to convert pandas df to Numpy. 
#.values convert df to Numpy array

X = df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']].values  #.astype(float)

## DATA NORMALIZATION
# Data Standardization gives the data zero mean and unit variance, it is good practice, 
# especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based on the distance of data points. 

X = StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))
# StandardScaler().fit_transform(X.astype(float)) might be preferred

## Train Test Split

# then choose k =1, use the training part for modeling, and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. 
# Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your model.
