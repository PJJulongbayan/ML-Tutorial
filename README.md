# ML-Tutorial

**This is a work in progress.**
This repository showcases Python code examples for model training using different ML algorithms. However, please note that the files within this repository do not contain deployment-level solutions. This repository is intended for educational purposes and is not a deployment-grade repository.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python3 and a code editor installed in your system along with the following packages and libraries:
1. Data processing, analysis and manipulation: Pandas, numpy,csv, json
2. Visualization and Charting: Matplotlib and seaboarn
3. Machine learning: scikit-learn
   
## Contents 

1. Train-test data split to avoid leakage
2. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
3. Classification and regression algorithms. *WIP*. 
4. Mini-projects (putting it all together). *WIP*. 

## Dataset 
1. Dataset are fetched directly in the code as they might change in content and form depending on the exercise.
2. For the mini-projects, full data description is provided within the code for reference.
